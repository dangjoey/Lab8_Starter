1. Within a Github action that runs whenever code is pushed because it is a preventative measure to ensure that the code that will be push is working correctly.

2. No, I would you use an end to end test to check if a function is returning the correct output.

3.  No, I use a unit test to test the “message” feature of a messaging application becasue an e2e test would be better to test the features since a unit test would require too much complexity.

4. Yes, I would use a unit test to test the "max message length" feature of a messaging application becasue it would be a good feature to limit users from over sending a message and it is a function that can be easily implemented.
